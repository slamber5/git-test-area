Hello, this is a text file.
I am editing this file
To test for things that might go wrong in time
And epically derail my PhD
By making git a mess to deal with woes
That drive my mind insane eventually
And in my everlonging hopes to make
A thing get published in a journal great
I hope to God git won't delete my work
And make computers more a thing I hate

PART I: Two Merges Diverged in a not-mellow Wood
I am Job of biblical reknown
In style poetic quite far from my own
